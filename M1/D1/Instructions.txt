- Extract to your desired folder, i.e. C:\. Your base folder should be solr-5.5.0
- Copy the 'coursesdemo' folder from Demos folder into \solr-5.5.0\server\solr
- Open a command line and navigate inside the \solr-5.5.0 folder
- Run bin\solr.cmd start
- Navigate to http://localhost:8983/solr/ to confirm Solr is running
