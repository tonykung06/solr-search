Instructions on how to set up the 'courses' core
- In the previous demo we created the core by running the following command
	\solr-5.5.0>bin\solr.cmd create -c courses
- Confirm it is empty
- Now index some data by running (I just want to show you how Solr's data driven schema creates fields and reloads the core - we will learn how to build this demo soon)
	\pluralsight-solrnet\Demos\M3\D2\Index A Few Documents\M5.D1.IndexConsole.exe
- In the query screen just execute query and you will see the indexed documents
- This is data driven schema. Now let's learn how to specify explictly fields using schema.xml
- Modify solrconfig.xml 
	- To use ClassicIndexSchemaFactory as explained in the course and also available in Completed folder
	- Comment out AddSchemaFieldsUpdateProcessorFactory
	- Add as default field _text_
- Modify schema.xml
	- Add fields as explained in the course and also available in Completed folder
	- Set unique key
